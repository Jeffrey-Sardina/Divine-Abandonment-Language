# Grammar

## Word Order
VOS word order. We'll go with the "default" secondary word orders for a VOI primary word order; that is
- adjective - noun
- relative clause - noun
- noun - preposition

## Culture and Design Principles
A native language of the Divine Abandonment world

Principles
- speak about things in terms of absence and motion to or away (i.e. "sadness left me" --> I am happy)
- motion away (and the concept of absence) tends to have a more positive connotation (i.e. words like leave). Motion towards (and the concept of presence) has a more negative intention in general (akin to the English "intrude")
- common phrases should be in terms of motion (i.e. I like X maybe literally translate as "my desire moves towards X")
- heavy use of colour metaphors to assign meaning (like "blue blooded" in English)
- use of place names / geography to describe ideas (so "a forest of thoughts" may mean "a lot of thoughts"). Thus, a very strong connection to the land

## Some basics

### Stress
In the absence of any other applicable rule, stress falls on the penultimate syllable.

ai and aei at the end of a word attract stress.
- ai and aei that do not receive stress de-animate to "eh" and "uh" respectively. Similarly, if a change makes them receive stress, they gain the dipthong quality
- This de-animation will also often occur in words said often and quickly -- i.e. pronouns

### Infixes
Infixes typically follow the stressed syllable in a word. However, if the stressed syllable is last, they precede it.

They tend to be very short CV constructions.

### Pronouns
Pronouns do not make a gender distinction, but do make a *number* distinction in singular / plural. An inclusion / exclusion distinction is made in the first person (only). Third person pronouns belong to one of X classes:
- living things (including plants, animals, etc. Ex tree, fish, elf)
- present things (i.e. positive-presence words and some concrete nouns. Ex Rock, valley)
- absent things (i.e. words implying absence and abstract nouns. Ex god, happiness, darkness)

In the plural, only the present-absent distinction is made (so there is no plural of living things -- those would generally be lumped into "present")

For personal pronouns, this gives us:
- I -- dhai
- you -- kse
- it (living) -- tse
- it (present) -- sha
- it (absent) -- lhii
- --
- We (incl) -- mlae
- We (excl) -- so
- yous -- rii
- they (present) -- nra
- they (absent) --  nhii

"nh" is affixed to the end to form object pronouns. 

### Verbs
Verbs can have any ending, **except** for "e", "a" and "ii", as those are reserved for nouns. However, i proactive, all but a few of the most common (and thus less regular) verbs end in the other vowels: ae, aei, ai, o, and i, which serve as suffixes. Verbs that do not end in a vowel are only ever on 1 syllable, and have no suffix.

In terms of conjugations, they take a few tenses: present, past, and future. They also take the imperative, conditional, subjunctive, and indicative moods and the progressive, near, habitual, and perfect aspects.

Verbs have 2 parts: a root and a suffix. The suffix is just the last syllable, unless the verb has only one syllable, in which case there is no suffix. Any time a conjugation affects a verb, the suffix (if present) is dropped.

SSuffixes typically change to reflect the subject, and when given the subject pronoun is typically not used.

#### Simple present
Simple present verbs take a suffix in place of the verb's suffix. Note that the initial "ai" in "(ai)dh" is pronounced exclusively in it's DEANIMATED state as "eh". The vowel following that suffix determines the subject:
- (ai)dhai -- I
- (ai)dhe -- you
- (ai)dhi -- it (living)
- (ai)dha -- it (present)
- (ai)dhii -- it (absent)

The plurals are different. In some cases "th" replaces "dh" (when the vowel in the root would repeat). However, for the "living" class, the suffix "(e)dha" is used.
- (ai)dhae -- we (incl)
- (ai)dho -- we (excl)
- (ai)the -- yous
- (ai)dha -- they (living)
- (ai)tha -- it (present)
- (ai)thii -- it (absent)

#### Simple past (preterite)
Simple past verbs take a suffix in place of the verb's suffix. Note that the initial "aei" in "(aei)zh" is pronounced exclusively in it's DEANIMATED state as "uh". The vowel following that suffix determines the subject:
- (aei)zhai -- I
- (aei)zhe -- you
- (aei)zhi -- it (living)
- (aei)zha -- it (present)
- (aei)zhii -- it (absent)

The plurals are different. In some cases "sh" replaces "zh" (when the vowel in the root would repeat). However, for the "living" class, the suffix "(aei)zha" is used.
- (aei)zhae -- we (incl)
- (aei)zho -- we (excl)
- (aei)she -- yous
- (aei)zha -- they (living)
- (aei)sha -- it (present)
- (aei)shii -- it (absent)

#### Simple Future
Simple future verbs take a suffix in place of the verb's suffix.The vowel following that suffix determines the subject:
- (i)nai -- I
- (i)ne -- you
- (i)ni -- it (living)
- (i)na -- it (present)
- (i)nii -- it (absent)

The plurals follow the pattern above as so:
- (i)nae -- we (incl)
- (i)no -- we (excl)
- (i)nhe -- yous
- (i)na -- they (living)
- (i)nha -- it (present)
- (i)nhii -- it (absent)

#### Aspect and Mood
Aspect is forming from a regular word using a helping word. That word changes based on what aspects are applied. Note that the subjunctive also words this way, since it applies to words in the past, present, or future.
- near (only) -- go
- habitual (only) -- ko
- progressive (only) -- tsha
- perfect (only) -- mi
- near progressive -- tshi 
- near perfect -- mo
- subjunctive -- se

The conditional is different -- it can only be applied to the past form of a verb. It takes the exact same form as the subjunctive in that case, and when either meaning could apply, the conditional is assumed.

This word goes directly before the word (if it cannot infix) or else infixes.

### Articles
We have definite, indefinite, and indefinite specific articles. These change form based on the noun class, just like pronouns. Their ending is determined by the class -- "e" for living (singular only), "a" for present, "ii" for absent.

The stems for each of these forms are given below

Definite:
- singular: l-
- plural: w-

Indefinite:
- singular: kth-
- plural: x-

Indefinite specific (in the singular only; no plural exists)
- singular: same as indefinite plural

### Nouns
All nouns have 2 parts:
- a root
- a suffix. The suffix is always "e", "a" or "ii" in the base form, and matches noun class.

Nouns have a nominative - accusative distinction. For singular nouns, the accusative if formed by added "nh" added to the end of a noun. This means that the language can use VOS or VSO, but the "default" order is more commonly VOS. For plural nouns, there is no nominative-accusative distinction except by context and / or word order.

No other cases exist -- meaning the language makes heavy use of prepositions and prepositional phrases (part of how everything is based on movement)

Nouns take a singular - plural distinction.
- For "living" nouns, this is easiest -- the "e" changes to "a" or (rarely) "ii" as appropriate. No other changes are made. This can then be transformed into the accusative by adding "nh" as normal.
- for "present" and "abstract" nouns, "lh" is added as a suffix. This means that forming the accusative is no longer possible, so the nominative-accusative distinction is not made in these plurals. THis is part of why the language's word order is still somewhat strict.

### Adjectives
"Simple adjectives" have the same structure (i.e. endings) as nouns, and change the same way nouns do grammatically for agreement.

There is a fixed set of "infix adjectives" that instead operate on nouns as infixes after the stressed syllable. After the infix operation, the formerly stressed syllable **still receives stress**, which allows easily distinguishing an infixed word from a root. This area of the language is not very productive -- few words tend to be added or removed from it.

### Adverbs formed from Adjectives
"Simple adverbs". These are formed by
- removing of the final vowel, if the word would end on a valid consonant (lh, dh, m, nh, or sh) and has at least 2 sylables. The stress does not move when this happens.
- otherwise, the stress moves to the final syllable to indicate that the word is now an adverb. This stress change is not written, but remains implicit.

These and tend to go directly before the thing they modify.

There is also a fixed set of "infix adverbs" that can infix into verbs and simple adjectives as described above. This area of the language is not very productive -- few words tend to be added or removed from it.

### Relative pronouns
Relative pronouns offset relative clauses. These have a root, and their suffix determine their class and number exactly as is they were nouns.
- ainh-
- edh-
- aedh-

### Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstratives pronouns take 3 forms: this (near speaker), that (nor listener), and yon (near neither). These have a root, and their suffix determine their class and number exactly as is they were nouns.
- This: iinh-
- That: im-
- Yon: silh-

### Questions
Question words are the same as relative pronouns; when used in a question, they must come first. These serve to mean "what" / "who", and the word that followed determine what is being asked (i.e. "what way" for how, etc).

For all other questions, general question word "lo" precedes the question, which is formed otherwise as a statement.

### Negation
Verb negation for 1-syllble verbs is done with the negative particle "who". This is also done if the verb being negated already has an infix (though that is rare -- it is more standard to remove the very infix and say that with a simple adverb instead in common use of the language).

In all other cases, "who" is infixed to the verb being negated using standard infix rules.
