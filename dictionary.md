## Derivation of Basic Phrases
1) **English** -- **literal translation**
I like X       -- My liking comes from X

We first need to change this into the right word order. It's best to do this incrementally rather than all at once at first, to help develop an intuition for it:

COME (from X) (my liking)         | apply VOS word order
--> COME (X from) (my liking)     | prepositions come after the noun
--> COME (X from) (my liking)     | my literally means "red"
--> COME-FROM (X) (my liking)     | come-from is a single verb
--> (soli) (X) ((dhaixa) (nga))   | get words in, agreement not applied
--> (soli) (X) (dhaixa nga)       | apply noun-adj agreement
--> (solidha) (X) (dhaixa nga)    | apply verb-subject agreement

Now that we have a basic grammatic structure, we can say something we like? Let's start with something simple: books! Thw word for book (singular) is "snora". This gives us

--> (solidha) (snora-plural) (dhaixa nga)      | add in object word
--> (solidha) (snoralh) (dhaixa nga)           | put "snora" in plural
--> solidha snorai dhaixaanga                  | complete sentence

This means "My liking comes from books", which is how we express "I like books". To be even more literal, this means "Red liking comes from books".

What about the length -- should we be worried?
- we have 8 syllables
- In English (I like books) this takes 3 syllables. 
- In Spanish ((A mÃ­) me gustan los libros) this takes 6-8 syllables
- In Irish (Is maith liom leabhra) this takes 5 syllables

However, English has a much broader set of sounds, looser phonetic rules, and less agreement. Spanish is much closer in terms of phonetic restrictions, and were are slightly stricter even than that. So this is not unreasonable -- even if it is on the longer side. 

**New Words:**

**soli** 1. (v) to come from.

**nga** 1. (n) liking. (note -- this noun is a present noun since it implies the positive presence of liking. Used with *soli*, it means that your liking left the object and came to you, much like how light came to the sun by leaving the world)

**snora** 1. (n) book. 

**xa** 1. (n. infix) relating to, regarding.


2) **English**     -- **literal translation**
My name is X       -- I am left with my X

Ok, before we even think about work order here we need to ask: what does it mean to have a name. Name is identity, and identity is absence.  In other words, everything but your name left you, so it alone remains with you -- hat is how absence defines you in this language.

As a result, I like "I am left with X" as a beginning for a phrase. I think this phrase can be used to express lots of identity, from emotions (I am left with happiness) to names (I am left with the name X). However -- that's very long. So lets use colours again -- "I am left with my X" implies ownership -- so it's a fine way to express a name. This also helps explain why the colour-pronoun things is a thing in this language.

We have:

My name is X       -- I am left with my X

And then we can dissect this:
I am left with my X
--> left-with (my X) (I)       | apply word order
--> (lhaedi) (dhaixa X) (dhai) | insert existing words (a name is living since it refers to you as you)
--> (lhaedidhai) (dhaixa X)    | verb agreement -- this allows us to drop the personal pronoun
--> lhaedidhai dhaixa X        | sentence!

**New Words:**

**lhaedi** 1. (v) to be left with.


2) **English**     -- **translation**
Jeffrey (my name)   -- Mriizelhe (r being an allophone of d that sounds like the Irish slender r here)

The etymology of Jeffrey is "good peace". The good --> god is how we got things like "Godfrey", which are related phrases. Let's try to replicate this, so I can say my name! To do this, we need two things: a noun (peace) and a adjective (good). Good is a very common adj, so we'll add it to the list of adjectives that we infix.

Finally, we change the type to living to indicate its a name. Only names change endings this way, to distinguish them from the same term not used as a name.

We don't have any roots for "peace" or "good" (or related terms) yet, so let's make one from our generated words list!

**New Words:**

**mriilhii** 1. (n) peace. (an absent noun, since it is known by the absence of anything not peaceful)

**zii** 1. (v) good.


2) **English**                                        -- **literal translation**
That which has no silence (name for this language)    -- Mlaiwhiidii

We already have "who" as a negative infix. So new we just need a word for silence

**New Words:**

**mlaidii** 1. (n) silence. (an absent noun, since it is known by the absence of anything not silent)


2) **English**     -- **translation**
Ailbhe (name)      -- zhawhede

Ailbhe means bright or white, and could be connected to the dawn. In other words, it is the loss of darkness. So I think "without dark" works quite well here! We just need a word for dark now. Finally, we change the type to living to indicate its a name.

**zhada** 1. (n) darkness. (an present noun, since dark is the thing whose absence makes light)

**wha** 1. (gen. infix) no, not (serves as a negative particle).



**Let's have fun with colour (said the colourblind man!)**
Colour associations are important to this language. When used without articles they also serve as possessives. These are absent nouns, since a colour is known by what is not in it.

**kthii** 1. (n, adj) red.

**sii** 1. (n, adj) orange.

**ghii** 1. (n, adj) yellow.

**ngii** 1. (n, adj) green.

**mhii** 1. (n, adj) blue.

**snhii** 1. (n, adj) purple.

**nlii** 1. (n, adj) black.

**whii** 1. (n, adj) white.

**lii** 1. (n, adj) grey.

**tshii** 1. (n, adj) brown.
